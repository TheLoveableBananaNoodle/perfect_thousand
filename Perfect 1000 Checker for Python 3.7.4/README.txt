Perfect thousand checker.

What is the perfect thousand?
The perfect thousand is a class game where students draw a three by three grid. From there, the teacher will shout out nine random numbers, ranging from 0 to 9. The students then fill out the gird with each number going in one random box until the grid is filled. From there, the top, middle and bottom three numbers are classed as one number each and if they add up to one thousand that student is the winner. Winning the game is deemed rare and is therefore deemed honourable/lucky.

What does this program do?
This program will require the user to input the nine numbers shouted out by the teacher and will tell the user if the perfect thousand is possible. If it is possible, it will show them what numbers to put in each grid. It is designed to quickly figure out if a game was possible if no one won.
