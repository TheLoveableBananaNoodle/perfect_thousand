# Perfect Thousand Checker
Perfect thousand checker is a small application developed for three seperate releases; Java 8, Python 3.7.4 or C++. It simply asks the user to input the numbers required and checks to see if the game was possible. The application is open source at GitHub, so you can use it educationally as well.

# What is the perfect thousand game?
Although I do not know who made the game, I was first introduced to it by a teacher named "Mr. Gunning". The game is simple. Students draw a 3x3 gird. Next, they fill the grid number by number as nine random numbers ranging from 0 to 9 are read out to the class. From there, the top row, middle row and bottom row are classed as one number each. Should a student use the three numbers to make the sum of one thousand, they win. Winning is both luck and skill based on prediction, so winning is quite rare. Because of this, winning is said to give good luck and/or honourability. The class that I'm in when I play it even have a special board for pictures of the people who won.

# How to use this program (C++)?
- Install the C++ release of this application.

- As far as I'm aware, C++ is built-into windows (although I don't actually know to be honest, which is probably bad for me). If I'm correct, you should be able to just use the launcher named `Perfect 1000 Checker` to run the application.
